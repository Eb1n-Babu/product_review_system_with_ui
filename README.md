Product Review System üåü
Hey there! Welcome to the Product Review System, a beginner-friendly RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), paired with a minimal frontend using Django templates! This project was crafted with guidance from Grok (created by xAI) and GitHub Copilot, along with API references, to ensure a robust and clear implementation. Whether you're new to coding or looking for a clean project to showcase, this offers an easy setup, organized code, a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, and detailed Postman testing instructions. The Git commit history is tidy for smooth GitHub submission. Let‚Äôs get started! üòÑ

What‚Äôs This Project About?
This API and frontend let you manage products, post reviews, and handle user roles with ease. Here‚Äôs the overview:

Admins üëë can create, update, or delete products via the API or frontend forms.
Regular users üë§ can browse products, submit one review per product (1-5 star rating with feedback), and view their reviews.
Everyone üåç (even without logging in) can view products and their average ratings.
Security üîí uses token-based authentication and CSRF protection for secure form submissions.
Frontend üåê: A minimal, responsive interface with Django templates (base.html, index.html, product.html), styled with styles.css (optimized for smaller login fields) and powered by scripts.js (with input validation and CSRF handling).

Cool Features

Products: Include name, description, price, and auto-calculated average rating.
Reviews: Feature 1-5 star ratings and feedback, with a rule to prevent duplicate reviews per product.
User Roles: Supports admin and regular users via a profile system.
Data Goodies: Product listings display average ratings and review counts.
Frontend: Clean UI with login, product listing, review submission, and admin controls, enhanced with input validation to prevent errors.
RESTful Design: Follows best practices with robust error handling and validation.

The project is organized into three Django apps (products, reviews, users) for the backend, with templates/ and static/ directories for the frontend.

Quick Notes üìù

Authentication: Use Authorization: Token <token> in headers for protected endpoints.
Admin Roles: Set via the Django admin panel.
No Duplicate Reviews: A unique_together constraint prevents multiple reviews per product.
Ratings: Average ratings are auto-calculated for products.
CSRF Protection: Forms include CSRF tokens, and scripts.js handles them for secure submissions.
Input Validation: Frontend validates inputs to prevent 400 Bad Request errors.


Frontend Overview üåê
The frontend uses Django templates for a minimal, user-friendly interface:

Templates:
base.html: Shared layout with header and navigation.
index.html: Login form (optimized for smaller fields, with CSRF token) and product list with admin controls for creating products.
product.html: Product details, reviews, and review submission form (with CSRF token), with admin controls for editing/deleting products.


Static Files:
styles.css: Responsive styling with a blue-and-white theme, optimized for smaller login fields.
scripts.js: Handles API calls with fetch, includes CSRF token handling, and validates inputs to prevent errors.


Features:
Login/logout with token storage in localStorage.
Browse products with average ratings and review counts.
Submit reviews (authenticated users).
Create, update, and delete products (admin users only).


Access: Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ for the home page and http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/?id=<product_id> for product details.


Testing with Postman üß™
Test the API using Postman (download from postman.com). Below are key test cases:

Get a Token üîë  

Create a new request in Postman.  
Set Method: POST, URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/.  
Go to Body tab, select raw, choose JSON, and enter:{
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
}


Click Send. Expect a 200 OK response:{
    "token": "your_token_here"
}


Copy the token for authenticated requests.


Create a Product (Admin) üõç  

Create a new request.  
Set Method: POST, URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/.  
Go to Headers tab and add:  
Authorization: Token your_token_here (replace with token from step 1)  
Content-Type: application/json


Go to Body tab, select raw, choose JSON, and enter:{
    "name": "Test Product",
    "description": "A test product",
    "price": 19.99
}


Click Send. Expect 201 Created (success) or 403 Forbidden (if not admin). Test invalid data (e.g., {"name": ""}) for 400 Bad Request.


Submit a Review (Regular User) ‚≠ê  

Create a new request.  
Set Method: POST, URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/<product_id>/reviews/ (replace <product_id> with a valid ID, e.g., 1).  
Go to Headers tab and add:  
Authorization: Token your_token_here  
Content-Type: application/json


Go to Body tab, select raw, choose JSON, and enter:{
    "rating": 5,
    "feedback": "Great product!"
}


Click Send. Expect 201 Created (success) or 400 Bad Request (if already reviewed or invalid rating).


List Products (Public) üõç  

Create a new request.  
Set Method: GET, URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/.  
No headers needed (public endpoint).  
Click Send. Expect 200 OK with a list of products, including average_rating and review_count.


Manage Users in the Admin Panel üñ•  

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ in your browser.  
Log in with superuser credentials.  
Add users (Users > Add user) and assign roles (User Profiles > Add user profile, set role to admin or regular).  
Tip: Create an admin user for product management and a regular user for review testing.




Testing the Frontend üñ•
Test the frontend to verify functionality and error handling:

Login: Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/, enter superuser credentials, and submit. Try empty fields to confirm validation errors (e.g., "Username and password are required.").
Create Product: Log in as an admin, fill out the product creation form, and submit. Test invalid inputs (e.g., empty name, negative price) to verify error messages.
Submit Review: Log in as a regular user, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/?id=1, and submit a review. Test invalid ratings (e.g., 0 or 6) to confirm validation.
Edit/Delete Product: As an admin, edit and delete a product. Verify redirects and confirmation prompts.
Check Console: Open Developer Tools (F12 > Console) to inspect errors during form submissions.


Updating to GitHub üì§
To update the project on GitHub with the latest fixes (CSRF handling and input validation), run these commands from the project directory:
git add static/scripts.js README.md
git commit -m "Add input validation to scripts.js to fix 400 Bad Request errors and update README"
git push origin main

Replace main with your branch name if different (e.g., master).If the repository isn‚Äôt set up, create one on GitHub and link it:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/product-review-system.git


Why It‚Äôs Awesome üåü

Product Management üõç: Admins can add, edit, or delete products via the API or frontend. Everyone can browse products.  
Review System ‚≠ê: Authenticated users can leave one 1-5 star review per product with feedback, with validation to prevent errors.  
User Roles üë•: Supports admin and regular users with token-based access.  
Frontend üåê: Responsive Django templates with optimized login forms, CSRF protection, and client-side validation for robust error handling.  
Smart Data üìä: Product listings show auto-calculated average ratings and review counts.  
Secure üîí: Uses tokens, role-based permissions, CSRF protection, and input validation.  
Error Handling ‚ö†Ô∏è: Clear HTTP status codes (400 for invalid data, 401 for not logged in, 403 for unauthorized) and user-friendly frontend messages.


A Few Things to Know üìù

Secret Key üîê: The SECRET_KEY in settings.py is for development. Generate a new one for production using a Django secret key tool.  
CORS üåê: CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True is suitable for testing but should be restricted in production (e.g., CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["http://127.0.0.1:8000"]).  
Database üóÑ: Uses SQLite for simplicity. Consider PostgreSQL for production.  
User Setup üë§: Create users and roles via the admin panel. A signup feature could be a fun addition!  
Git History üìú: Commits are clear and descriptive for easy review.  
Frontend Setup üåê: Templates in templates/ and static files in static/ are served by Django. Run python manage.py collectstatic for production.  
CSRF Protection: Forms include {% csrf_token %} and scripts.js handles tokens for secure API requests.  
Input Validation: Client-side checks in scripts.js prevent 400 Bad Request errors by ensuring valid data.  
Resources Used üìö: Built with guidance from Grok (created by xAI), GitHub Copilot, and API references for a well-structured implementation.
